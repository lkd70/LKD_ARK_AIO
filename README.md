# ARK_All_In_One
An all in one macro script for Ark: Survival Evolved

## Startup

Upon starting the script, it'll do a quick startup procedure - This will wait until you've tabbed
in to the game window and then attempt to set your gamma to default. This is a requirement for the
propper functionality of the script.

## HotKeys

### Right-CTRL

This simply holds down "w" until you either click 'right-ctrl' again or hit 'w'

### Right-Shift

Holds down shift until you either hit 'shift' or click 'right-shift' again

### F1 - Farming Meat

This mode will access the inventory of the tame you're riding, remove any unwanted junk, only keeps 
meat

### F2 - Feed Berries

This will access the inventory of the tame you're riding and drop everything except from berries 
that are used for food

### F3 - Metal/Shard Farmer

This will access the inventory of whatever dino you're riding and drop stone, wood, thatch, hide, 
meat, obsidian, and some other unneeded junk when farming element shards or metal.

### F4 - Owl Heal Jump

Assuming you're sitting on a healing owl, using this will start a freeze heal and jump off of the 
owl, leaving the owl to heal whilst you continue to do other things. Be aware, you can freeze 
yourself by accident if you don't move quickly after running this.

### F5 - AutoClick

This simply spams left click every 50 milliseconds. Hitting F5 will toggle this on/off.

### F6 - Dedi Drop

This dumps 300 slots from a dedi you're looking in to. This is done by transferring all slots to 
your inventory first. To take full advantage of this, crouch and drop a bag, don't move, access the 
dedi and start this. This can be stopped at anytime by clicking F6 again.

### F7 - F-Modes

This toggles which F-mode is selected, by default the F-mode is set to "off", this means that the 
normal "F" function is used. When changing the mode, clicking F will have a different function on 
the game. The F modes are listed below

#### Available F Modes:

0. Off - No function
1. Meat Feed - Access the dino you're looking at, remove spoiled/oil, feed raw. 
2. Berry Feed - Access the dino you're looking at, feed berries
3. Crop Plots - Empty crop plots, fill again with fert
4. Access inventory, take all (useful for quickly looting bags)
5. transfer hide to local inventory from remote and drop all else. Good for frog mission

### F8 - SlotBot

Stand in front of a transmitter and let the magic happen

### F9 - Reload

Simply reloads the script

### F10 - Owl Heal AFK

This mode is quite simple, activate this whilst sitting on an owl and it will freeze every 15 seconds or so. This will allow you to go grab a cup of tea whilst all your tames are healed up

Please note that the feature set of this script is intended for everyday use. Anything that isn't used in regular active gameplay (such as bots to automate entire processes) isn't right for this script. This is purely to assist you in your gameplay, not to play the game for you
